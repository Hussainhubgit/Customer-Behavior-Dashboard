# Customer-Behavior-Dashboard
Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis.

This project analyzes 3,900 customer purchases to understand shopping patterns and help businesses make smarter decisions. The dataset contains 18 columns covering customer demographics, product details, purchase information, and behavior. Basic data cleaning was done, including handling missing values—only the Review Rating column had gaps, which were filled using median values. I performed feature engineering by creating age groups and purchase frequency categories to better understand customer segments. The cleaned data was also connected to PostgreSQL for deeper analysis.

Through this project, I explored how different factors affect spending—such as gender, discount usage, shipping preferences, and subscription status. Key findings include higher revenue from female customers, higher spending among express shipping users, and strong loyalty and revenue contribution from subscribers. The analysis also identified top-rated products and segmented customers into Loyal, Returning, and New groups to support targeted marketing strategies.

The final insights helped in suggesting business actions like boosting subscriptions, improving loyalty programs, promoting top-rated products, and focusing on high-value customer groups to increase revenue and retention.

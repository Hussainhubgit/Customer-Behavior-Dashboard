# Customer-Behavior-Dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing 3,900 customer transactions using Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI data visualization tools to uncover shopping patterns and revenue drivers. The dataset included 18 features related to customer demographics, product details, pricing, shipping, and purchasing behavior. Initial data preparation involved loading the dataset using Pandas, performing exploratory data analysis, and handling missing values—specifically imputing the Review Rating column using median imputation.

I performed feature engineering, including creating age groups, purchase frequency metrics, and behavior-based customer segments. The cleaned dataset was integrated into PostgreSQL, where SQL queries were used for aggregated analysis such as revenue by gender, discount usage patterns, and shipping-type impact on purchase value. Insights were visualized using tools such as Power BI to highlight patterns like higher spending among female customers, increased revenue from express shipping, and strong retention rates among subscribers.

Further analysis identified top-rated products and segmented customers into Loyal, Returning, and New categories for targeted marketing strategies. Based on these insights, strategic recommendations were developed, including enhancing subscription-driven benefits, strengthening loyalty programs, focusing on high-value customer segments, and promoting best-rated products to increase long-term revenue and customer retention.
